# Victoria training log

One markdown file per training version. Source of truth for what was
tried, what happened, and what's next. Replaces ad-hoc notes in run
dirs, memory files, and chat history.

## How to use

- Write a new `V###.md` **before** kicking off the run (hypothesis +
  planned change), update it **after** the run (gate results +
  conclusion + next steps).
- Use `_template.md` as the starting point.
- Update the high-water-mark table below whenever a new run beats an
  existing per-gate best.
- Linked from `.claude/skills/victoria-training-loop/SKILL.md` — the
  skill enforces the loop.

## High-water marks (as of 2026-05-28)

| Gate    | Best version          | PnL        | Trades | WR    | PF   | Notes                                                  |
|---------|-----------------------|-----------:|-------:|------:|-----:|--------------------------------------------------------|
| recent  | **V199** (carry sub)  | **+$2,478**| 67     | 34.3% | 1.13 | Carry-only sub-strategy + carry in per-ticker ensemble |
| trend   | V172 (`pruned`)       | **+$18,437**| 64    | 43.8% | 2.07 | Ridge calibrator + signal pruning (V199 regressed here)|
| crisis  | *no positive run*     | best −$35K | —      | —     | —    | Whole stack is trend-biased; crisis remains unsolved   |

Regime parity is the #1 open problem: trend & recent positive, crisis
consistently negative across V170s–V190s. V199 broke the recent
high-water but regressed on trend — V200 owns the trend-regime
suppressor that should recover both.

## Phase index

| File             | Phase                          | Key takeaway                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [V148.md](V148.md) | Pre-loop baseline              | meta_learner_exit_only + continuous_sizing — last commit on main pre-loop    |
| [V172.md](V172.md) | IC + ensemble foundation       | Ridge calibrator + signal pruning. Best trend number to date.                |
| [V176.md](V176.md) | Live ensemble high-water       | V175 loosened thresholds + vix in composite. +$1,189 live, 31 trades.        |
| [V185.md](V185.md) | Microstructure (VPIN/Kyle/OFI) | Strong on snapshots, anemic live (needs WS accumulation).                    |
| [V189.md](V189.md) | Gate stacking diminishing returns | Symbol blacklist + min hold + damp hours. V184 60d barely positive PF 1.04. |
| [V191.md](V191.md) | Range/carry attempt            | Range sub-strategy + funding-carry signal — carry gated behind range_bound=1.0 (rarely fires). |
| [V197.md](V197.md) | Observability reset            | PipelineTracer wired at all 6 boundaries; strategy_selector silent-override bug caught & fixed. |
| [V199.md](V199.md) | Carry-only sub-strategy        | New recent high-water (+$2,478, 67 trades). Trend regressed — fix in V200.    |

## The loop

The continual-improvement loop is codified in
`.claude/skills/victoria-training-loop/SKILL.md`. Short version:

1. Read latest `V###.md` → its **next steps** are the brief for V###+1.
2. Create `V###+1.md` with hypothesis + planned change.
3. Implement.
4. Run `scripts/run_training.py --version v###+1 --cycles 200` (or
   per-gate snapshots: `recent`, `trend`, `crisis`).
5. Fill in gate results, conclusion, next steps.
6. Update this README's high-water table if a record was broken.
7. Commit + push.
